# Translator

The repo contains a neural machine translator. The architecture contains four main components: encoder RNN, decoder RNN, and attention mechanism. The model design is inspired by the contents of the paper: [Affective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://www-nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/emnlp15_attn.pdf).
